The candelabra trembled as Lorenzo's fingers found the discordant chord. Dust sifted from the cathedral's ribbed vaulting like funeral ash, settling on his threadbare cassock. Beyond the stained glass, Venice drowned in a weeping mist that blurred the line between canal and sky.
"Sant'Angelo dei Sangue," the gondoliers whispered when poling past this accursed isle. The Church of Holy Blood earned its name when seven cardinals hemorrhaged from eyes and ears during its 1348 consecration. Now their gilded skeletons watched from reliquary niches, jawbones agape in eternal screams.
Lorenzo's left hand crawled across the organ's ebony keys like a black spider. The pipes exhaled a sound thicker than air - molasses tones pooling in shadowed corners, vibrating the lead-lined windows. His right hand hovered over the scarlet keys no mortal should touch. Three drops of tarnished silver glinted on their ivory surfaces. His birthright. His damnation.
The music sheet before him bled.
Not metaphorically. Thick crimson droplets welled from the parchment's edges, dripping onto the pedalboard where they sprouted hair-thin tendrils. The stench of opened graves rose with each measure. He knew this composition better than his own heartbeat. Requiem aeternam, the opening movement. Or it should have been.
"You're transposing the Dies Irae into the minor third," said a voice that smelled of embalming fluid.
Lorenzo's foot slipped on the creaking expression pedal. The discord shook bat-winged gargoyles from their stone perches. They circled the nave on leathern wings, their chiseled fangs snapping at the hanging incense censers.
The stranger stood where no living man should stand - directly beneath the Oculus Infernum. Moonlight through the demonic oculus window cast his silhouette in bleeding contours. His gloves were the color of dried placenta.
"Maestro Vitale's Missa da Mortuis calls for Phrygian mode here." The man held up skeletal fingers. Seven rings gleamed, each set with a different martyr's tooth. "But you...you play as if the Kyrie were written in Hell's own tongue."
Lorenzo's birthmark pulsed beneath his collar - three interlocking circles that matched the silver drops on the scarlet keys. "Who sent you? The Patriarch? The Council of Ten?"
"Your ancestors." The stranger's laugh echoed from multiple directions. "Hear how the Basso continuo answers you?"
A wet scraping sound came from beneath the marble floor. Something was dragging iron chains through the ossuary below. Lorenzo's fingers instinctively shaped an augmented fourth - the diabolus in musica. The candelabra flames inverted, burning downward into black wax.
"The blood moon rises in nine nights." The stranger pressed a parchment against Lorenzo's chest. It squirmed like living skin. "Finish what Bartolomeo Silvani began in 1523. His Magnum Opus remains in the crypt where your inquisition ancestors left his...pieces."
Lorenzo stared at the staved lines crawling across the parchment. The notes weren't ink. They were congealed blood arranged in arterial patterns. At the bottom margin, a familiar sigil pulsed - three silver circles enclosing a seventh chord resolution.
"Or don't." The stranger's form dissolved into woodsmoke smelling of burnt hair. "Let Venice drown in the chorus of the damned. Either way, maestro..."
His whisper lingered after his body vanished:
"The music will have its due."
